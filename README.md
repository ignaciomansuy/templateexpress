# Backend

## How to run it in development mode?

The backend runs using an Express Server Application based on Node JS. First of all, you need to run:

```bash
npm install
```

Now, you have to set the environment variables in a file named `.env`. Should follow the same structure as [example.env](./example.env) with these variables:
- `PORT` (*required*): Establishes the port where the server will run.

- `ORIGIN` (*optional*): Sets the valid origin for requests (CORS). The default value is 'localhost' and it works for dockerized DDBB.

- `DB_USER` (*required*): Sets a username for database. With the dockerized DDBB you can use any name.

- `DB_NAME` (*required*): Sets the database name. With the dockerized DDBB you can use any valid value.

- `DB_PASSWORD` (*required*): Sets the password for database. With the dockerized DDBB you can use any valid value.

- `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD` (*required*): Sets the root password for database. With the dockerized DDBB you can use any valid value. 

- `DB_HOST` (*optional*): Sets the host for database. The default value is 'localhost' and it works for dockerized DDBB.

After setting environment variables, you need an available MySQL database. You can use the dockerized DDBB only using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) with this command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Finally, start the application in development mode using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
